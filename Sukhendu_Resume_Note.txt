Murali,

  My understanding is that for this POC sukhendu can bill atleast 200 hrs.I am surprised to see its 168 hrs.The way it was communicated project will go in long term.Sukhendu left two other project to join this project on march in hope he has at least 200 hrs and will go project long term.He is in bench now and will not get paid until he has project.If you get any assignment from nationallife this week then its fine to bill 168 hrs or I request to help him to bill 200 hrs to cover some portions of his bench period.Appreciate your help.
